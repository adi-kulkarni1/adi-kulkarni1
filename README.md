<h1>My Portfolio and Journey</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

Hi there! I’m Aditya Kulkarni (also go by “Adi”) and at the time of writing I am going into my senior year of high school in Eden Prairie, Minnesota. 

I first started my journey in coding at around 2nd grade. I remember my dad one day showing me a game on Angry Birds on his new touchscreen smart phone, which was a big deal at the time. From then on, I was fascinated with new technology. During the winter of that same year, our school introduced us to the “Hour of Code” program which soon became an annual week-long event to introduce young elementary students to block coding. I was amazed about the things I could do just by dragging and stacking blocks within a blank space environment.

<h2>MIT App Inventor</h2>

Fast forward to 9th grade where I took AP CSP (my first school computer science class), I had already worked with the “Scratch” program to develop sprites and animation, HTML to develop my own local website, and python using a few basic libraries. For my APCSP project, I used MIT App Inventor to develop a score tracker for a table tennis match.

<h2>Java</h2>

In 10th grade, I took a deep dive into Java in my AP Computer Science A class where I got the chance to learn concepts such as polymorphism and inheritance. As a final project, a group of friends and I made a game called [GETAWAY](https://github.com/EPHS-Java-2020/final-post-ap-project-2020-team-mario/) where you get to control the main character who must dodge bullets from laser shooting rangers and outrun fast angry chickens in order to reach the getaway car.

<h2>Flutter App Development</h2>

With the extra time I gained during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, I got into app development using Flutter, a Google app development platform I used to build apps for Android and iOS. I started out by working on a project with a friend to create an app for a local gym called Xcel Fitness. After learning and gaining experience, I decided to begin working on my own app to address a common problem in Minnesota. After months of development, I published this app on the Google Play Store, called [Snow Reporter](jnjj)! The goal of this app was to help cities address areas where roads have not been cleaned by snowplows through crowdsourcing data on snow levels on roads across Minnesota, and more broadly the US. The app has two parts: a map that displays user reports of snow fall on roads and a form where users enter the amount of snowfall on roads and the location and time of the observation.

<h2>iOS-Specific App Development</h2>

In 11th grade, I took a class that specifically focused on iOS app development using Swift. Throughout the course, I got to see the similarities between Flutter and Swift development and advantages associated with each of them. In the end, I was able to leverage the multitude of sensors within the iPhone and iPad to create “Aero Clash”, a game that uses the device’s accelerometer and gyroscopic sensors to control a fighter jet that is trying to escape AI-guided enemy planes. One of my favorite power-ups for the user’s plane is the heat-seeking missiles that track the movement of enemy planes to destroy them. I have also published this game on the Apple App Store. Check it out! Outside of class, I also worked on a project using Python Django and React JS which allows students to post technology help questions and have them answered by other students and technology specialists. 

<h2>What I’m Currently Up To (Summer 2021)</h2>

Most recently, a team of students and I at [Futurist Academy](https://github.com/futuristacademy), a club which I have been leading more than a year, are working on a club management system that allows club captains and members to send and access data all in one place. This system has two parts: a [Flutter frontend web application](https://github.com/futuristacademy/EPHSClubSystemFF) with Firebase connectivity as well as a Java SpringBoot backend that houses the data in a HTTP server.

<h2>Programming Languages Summary</h2>

  * Python (matplotlib, pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, etc)
  * Java (from AP Computer Science course)
  * Dart (Flutter App Development, Android & iOS)
  * Swift (iOS App Development)
